# Easyski Web App

**Welcome** to the **Easyski Web App**! I am thrilled to finally be working on this project for real. Creating this _application_ has been an idea and sort of dream for a while now and I have finally found the right time to be working on it. Even though it _technically_ is an application, it feels more like a _tool_ for me.

## Introduction

I have a lot to say, but first, let's start with the obvious: _what is an Easyski_?
_Easyski_ is a mobile and web navigation application, focussed on guidance through Ski Resorts.

## What now?

Stay put, fret not, more information is to come!
