# Easyski Web App

**Welcome** to the **Easyski Web App**! I am thrilled to finally be working on this project for real. Creating this _application_ has been an idea and sort of dream for a while now and I have finally found the right time to be working on it. Even though it _technically_ is an application, it feels more like a _tool_ for me.

## Introduction

I have a lot to say, but first, let's start with the obvious: _what is an Easyski_?
_Easyski_ is a mobile and web navigation application, focussed on guidance through Ski Resorts.

## How it works

The application is really easy.

1. Go to [easyski.be](https://www.easyski.be) and login or create an account.
1. Now that you've created an account, you can search for your ski area in the top search bar.
1. Clink the **marker** next to the search bar to start placing markers where you want one.
1. Now that you've placed your markers, give them a proper name. This will help you later on!
1. Now select the **track** next to the search bar and click your markers in the correct order. You will be able to give them a name, which is required to understand the next step.
1. Now that your **tracks** are made, you can select the **route** at the top.
1. You are now able to change the oreder of the tracks if necessary.
1. Finally, you can download your created route as .gpx file and import it in your favourite viewer.
